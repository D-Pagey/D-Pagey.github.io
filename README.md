## Personal Website

This is a complete redesign of my original portfolio that I initially made 
during the FreeCodeCamp course. This project is live on my [website](https://www.danpage.co.uk).

I decided to go for as clean and minimalist look as possible, whilst trying to 
get across the pertinent information. 

This website was built using React and Create-React-App, no other frameworks or 
libraries were used.

**Improvements:**
- Check that CSS complies with DRY principle e.g. all the copy.


<!-- All of the code can be seen on Github with the Vanilla JS versions being in another branch. -->
