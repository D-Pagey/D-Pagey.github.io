## Personal Website

This is my personal website that I'll use to display the projects I have worked on in my journey to becoming a Junior Front End Developer. I plan to constantly update it with new projects. I would also like to keep the website framework-less and library-less whilst also adding new features and functionality to it.

Here is a link to my [website](https://www.danpage.co.uk).
